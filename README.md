# PracticeReviewVector

## Introduction:

A session to review about some common codes about Vector in C++. I review this session after learning the subject Advanced Programming at my university.

## Conclusion: 

Using Vector is quite advantageous because it is not obligatory for the programmer to know the size of an array in advance (Sound like a dynamic array)

## Just basic and simple !!! 

Simple is key ???
